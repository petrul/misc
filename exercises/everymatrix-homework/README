The main executable class is named everymatrix.homework.App . It listens on port localhost:8001
Run it like this:

$ java -jar everymatrix-homework.jar

A bash script that uses curl to illustrate posting bets and getting high stakes is ./requests.sh

The code is buildable using:

$ gradle clean build jar

Code structure notes:
    - Three Handlers manage processing of the three described REST endpoints.
    - Exceptions are translated to HTTP codes on bad request etc.
    - The in-memory "database" is named Registry and uses hashmaps for storing data.

Test cases can be found under test/
    - Unit tests are provided and one integration test

Note:
====
1. The correct way in Java projects to store sources is .java files under src/main/java
and .java test files under src/test/java

Most standard Java build systems (including Gradle and Maven) take into account this standard layout.
Since the exercise specifies src/ I put the sources there, although this is non-standard layout.
The test sources can be found, symmetrically, under test/

2. The homework description does not specify if one customer may or may not open several different sessions.
This work assumes one customer may open several sessions.
